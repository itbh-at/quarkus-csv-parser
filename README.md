# quarkus-csv-parser Project

Finger exercise to learn reactive, non-blocking programming using [Mutiny!](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/)

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

Or even better, use the [Quarkus CLI](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling):
``` shell script
quarkus dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.
